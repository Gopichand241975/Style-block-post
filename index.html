        <h2><b>Hello! I'm Gopichand</b></h2>
        <p>
          I'm a computer science student passionate about coding, learning, and building real-world projects. I began my journey with simple HTML pages and gradually developed an interest in web development and programming. Currently, I’m learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Git. I enjoy solving problems, designing responsive websites, and exploring how technology works behind the scenes. 
        </p>
        <p>
           Besides coding, I love reading, exploring nature, and helping others understand technology in simple ways.
           I believe in continuous learning and growing step by step.
